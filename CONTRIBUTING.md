To contribute to the respository:

4.  Work on the feature/bug/issue.
5.  Commit changes to the branch.
6.  Push changes to your forked repository.
7.  Open a PR to this repository describing what problem were you trying to solve, then briefly describe the codes you added. If you have created a new file/folder especially mention about its purpose. 
8.  Make sure to attach a screenshot of the results you achieved and try out all the possible features and ensure that they are working fine before making a pull request.
9.  Try to follow the code structure used in the project while implementing features similar to already implemented features.
10.  Incase you have to use database to implement a feature, first understand the structure of the database using [this](https://github.com/sushant-iit/QuickBills/blob/master/markdown_resources/quick-bills-72903-default-rtdb-export.json) dummy data.
8. Also, reference the issue# that you solved.
